# odin-advanced-html-and-css-homepage
Github repository for the Homepage project from the Odin Project's Advanced HTML and CSS course.

This was the first site that I've made to be totally responsive to all screen sizes. 

I relied on the natural responsiveness of HTML, responsiveness via flexbox and grid, and defined media queries for more drastic layout changes. 

I enjoyed this project and I find the work flow to be natural. I started this project by implementing the desktop layout, then created breakpoints for smaller screens. Next project I'll probably start with the mobile implementation first and try going the other way to see which method I prefer. 

The only animations I ended up using for this project were hover animations that scaled up the element when the cursor was over any of the link images. 

A live demo of this site can be found here: https://danielkurtsawyer.github.io/odin-advanced-html-and-css-homepage/

Make sure to resize the screen to see the responsiveness in action!
